# FluentAssertionsEx #
Extensions for [FluentAssertions](http://www.fluentassertions.com/).

## Purpose ##
This project holds a collection of custom assertions for FluentAssertions that we here at HivePeople have found useful.

Additionally it holds our NSubstitute <-> FluentAssertions bridge, to enable use of FluentAssertions when performing
argument matching in NSubstitute.

## Notes ##
Do not use the lower-case form of the project name or unintentional innuendos and teenaged giggling may result.
